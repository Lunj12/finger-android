# finger-android

This is a course project of the course Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course) by CentraleSupélec on Coursera. In this project, an Android app embedded with pretrained neural network is developed. The app is designed mainly for finger number recognition. The principal part of the pretrained neural network is a linear classifier implemented by TensorFlow Android interface.
